# GAMEGIRL
A very simple Game console for girls based on arduino Nano.

The console features :
- 4 color buttons with 4 color leds
- A 16X2 LCD screen for displaying menu and game information
- A Buzzer for music
- An On/Off switch
- A 9V battery as power source

For this version, the console has the form of a heat. I created it for my little daughter. Feel free to rebuild it with your own form and code your own games.


The console has a game registration mechanism, a Highscore saving in EEPROM, and integrates my RTTTL Music playing library (that you can find in my other repository) with the possibility of multitasking led animation (using PMW) with button reading screen updates and audio playing.
